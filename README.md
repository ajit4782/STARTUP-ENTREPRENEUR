Your task is to take the base shipping productivity tool and add in the ability for the new feature, the kanban board, to move shipping requests, to two new lane statuses (in-progress and complete). 

I’d like to suggest ProofHub for Kanban Project Management tool.
ProofHub can help you in this way:
•	No more "Long, messy email threads"
 
ProofHub Discussion topics eliminates those confusing email threads to relate information, search important stuff and stay on the topic. It gets your team, clients and stakeholders to collaborate on common topics effortlessly in one centralized place. And you can easily loop someone in the conversation whenever needed.
•	No more "Was I supposed to do that?"
 
ProofHub Tasks keeps your team running in the right direction by giving them a lucid view of their responsibilities. Assign tasks, set start and due dates, add labels and keep things on track. ProofHub notifies people whenever tasks are assigned to them and reminds them when they’re due. Everyone in the team gets a list of daily agenda. And managers get notified if something is overdue.
•	No more "Who'll be working on this next?"
 
ProofHub’s Boards and workflows lets you divide the project tasks into stages and assign a Basic or Kanban workflow to them. You even get the option to Customize workflows as per requirement. This gives the teams a clear path of how the tasks need to progress, notifies people when tasks reach their stage and they move it to the next stage once their part is done. As a manager, you get to keep an eye on the overall progress, identify bottlenecks and better manage the flow.
•	No more "Poorly planned projects"
 
•	ProofHub Gantt charts lets you create effective project roadmaps to plan the tasks and resources, and keep them on track. Create tasks, assign them to teams, set dependencies and ProofHub will take care of everything else. As a task gets delayed or is moved ahead, the dependent tasks move and adjust accordingly, automatically. It also gives you a clear idea of how the work is distributed, when it is expected to be completed so that you can iterate plans to keep the project agile.
•	No more "Missing deadlines and having different calendars"
 
ProofHub’s Calendar gives you one centralized place for planning and scheduling events, milestones and tasks, eliminating the need of having too many different calendars. Create recurring events and milestones, assign them to people, and ProofHub will remind them of the deadlines well before they are due. As a manager, you get notified whenever a deadline is moved or missed.
•	No more "Scattered and missing files"
 
ProofHub keeps your Files and documents centralized and organized, making it easy to collaborate and share them with teams and clients. Organizing files in folders gives everyone the power to be able to find the important files quickly whenever needed. You can also upload multiple versions of the same file to keep them grouped together and avoid dealing with too many copies of the same file without knowing which one is the latest.
•	No more "Who gets to access what?"
 
ProofHub’s Custom roles enables you to create different access levels for the remote teams, clients and stakeholders. Set roles to define who gets the ability to perform certain actions in your projects and access the different parts of your ProofHub. You can also create private areas within projects for important things that you’d like to keep within specific team members and clients.
•	No more "Waiting for hours to get quick answers"
 
ProofHub’s Group chat gives everyone the power to save time that is usually wasted in getting quick answers, feedback or even a quick “Go”. Start one-to-one or group chat, add teams and clients, and begin the conversation, be it casual or work related. Communicating in real-time and with the ones working with you on your projects ensures that they continue progressing smoothly. You get emojis too. :D
•	No more "Confusing and delayed feedback"
 
ProofHub’s built-in Proofing speeds up the file and document review process andbrings clarity in feedback sharing. Upload files, add collaborators and send invitation to the clients. Using the markup tools clients and stakeholders can easily proof, mark changes and quickly provide their feedback. Previous versions of the proofed file can be viewed anytime to keep a track of the feedback and changes requested earlier, making it easy to compare the proofs. Once the changes are made, the files can be approved with a click of a button.
•	No more "Did someone keep a track of the billable hours?"
 
ProofHub Timesheets ensures that you get the by-minute details of the time spent on tasks and projects, making it easy to bill your clients and getting paid on time. Create timesheets, set time estimates, track time spent on tasks and get reports by person and dates. Record time manually or use the timer for accurate time tracking to save the time spent on maintaining the records and to avoid human errors.
•	No more "Why can't I see the interface in my language?"
 
ProofHub’s interface is available in a number of supported languagesincluding English, French, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese and German. Everyone in the team and at the client’s end can use special keyboards to collaborate and manage projects, and they can also set the preferred language they use to see ProofHub. Even the notifications sent are in the same language.
•	No more "Projects and resources getting out of control"
 
ProofHub Reports give you a clear insight of how the projects are progressing. As a Manager, you can view project progress, track missing deadlines, overdue tasks and milestones to keep a bird’s eye view on the projects. Reports also show you how the resources are being utilized, and how much workload each team member has so that you can manage them more efficiently.
